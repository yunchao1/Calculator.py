• Function Definitions:
o Several functions are defined to perform different arithmetic operations: addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, second_power, and square_root.
o These functions take input parameters (numbers) and return the result of the respective operation.
• Display Menu Function (display_menu()):
o This function displays the menu of available operations to the user.
• Get Operation Choice Function (get_operation_choice()):
o This function prompts the user to enter their choice (an integer between 1 and 7).
o It validates the input to ensure it's within the valid range and returns the choice.
• Get Numbers Function (get_numbers()):
o This function prompts the user to enter two numbers for binary operations (addition, subtraction, multiplication, division).
o It validates the input to ensure it's numeric and returns the two numbers.
• Main Function (main()):
o This is the main function that orchestrates the entire program.
o It continuously displays the menu and prompts the user for input until the user chooses to exit.
o Depending on the user's choice, it either:
▪ Calls the get_numbers() function to get input numbers and then calls the appropriate arithmetic function to perform the operation.
▪ For operations that require only one number (second power and square root), it directly prompts the user for the number and then calls the respective function.
▪ If the user chooses to exit (option 7), it terminates the program.
• Execution (if __name__ == "__main__":):
o This block ensures that the main() function is executed only when the script is run directly, not when it's imported as a module in another script
